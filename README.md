<h2>Abstract</h2>
This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of classifying peopleâ€™s gender from a face image. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) will be used to train the model on a dataset of pre-labeled images.
The importance of the project comes from its multiple uses in various fields, such as:
<ul>
<li>
<h5>Verifying a person's identity:</h5>Gender identification models can be used to verify the identity of people in automated entry systems, such as facial recognition in smartphones or monitoring entry points.
</li>
<li>
<h5>Demographic data analysis:</h5> It can be used to understand and study the demographics of a specific human group, such as gender and age distribution in marketing campaigns or social media analytics.
</li>
<li>
<h5>Scientific research.</h5>
